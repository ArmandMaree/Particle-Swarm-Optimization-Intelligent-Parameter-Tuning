\begin{abstract}
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a optimization algorithm that models the flocking behaviour of certain species of animals in order to solve stochastic real-value problems. These algorithms use control parameters to make slight adjustments to how the swarm behaves. In this paper the author will be discussing the results of using a brute force approach to find these control parameters.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
A Particle Swarm Optimisor (PSO) is, as described by Lazincia \cite{lazinica2009particle}, an optimization algorithm that attempts to emulate the flocking/schooling behaviour of birds or fish when searching for food. This optimization can occur in a number of dimensions, each spanning across $\mathbb{R}$ \cite{kennedy1997discrete}. Each particle in the swarm has two primary components of influence: cognative and social. A third component, called the inertia weight, is used to regulate the maximum velocity that a particle can move at in a certain direction \cite{eberhart2000comparing}. In this paper, the author will explore the feasibility of finding the optimum value for each of these components by using a brute force search in a subset.
